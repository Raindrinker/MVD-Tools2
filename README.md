# Tools Scripting Deliverable

## Description

### 1. Unity Tools
The new created script is called `CustomEditorTools.cs` and can be found in the menu bar in `Tools/Custom Tools`. It's divided in diferent modules, such as:

* **Quick actions module:** Usual actions that we need to do often when developing videogames or in a 3D enviornment. In this case, we have a *Save all*, *Open Build Settings*, *Open Project Settings*, *Move selected gameobjects to the bottom* and *Duplicate GameObject/Selection*.

* **Grid Genertaor module:** 3D and 2D debug grid generator and snapping tool to the closest location. It would be really usefull for 2D games to align tilemaps, pixel art or create an easy way to organise and justify objects in the scene.

* **Debug tools module:** Semi-working version of an easy way to look at the cause of  your warnings and errors. The following console error code is pased and with each following button it will open you a browser tab with the page of that specific error or warning code. It can be an easy way to find solutions for your errors and warnings on the web.

### 2. Finishing MVD Tools
We have finish the placement tool by adding the code to apply certain Transform when placing objects in the scene. Besides, we've added a clear and random button to facilitate the developer/artist when placing new prefabs.

### 3. Whiteboxing with ProBuilder
The whitebox level consists in a simple level with a *dungeon*-like style. The workflow would be the following:

1. Find the "key"(aka donut) to open the doors.
2. You can enter in a wrong corridor. With a pressure plate that would trigger some arrows and a reward at the end of it.
3. The good corridor leads to the *boss room*, with 3 enemies and a mini-platform level to reach the final reward.
